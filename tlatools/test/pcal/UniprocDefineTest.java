Computing initial states...
Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated.
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 2.2E-19
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 6.0E-19
5 states generated, 4 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 4.
Finished. (2012-08-10 17:39:59)
